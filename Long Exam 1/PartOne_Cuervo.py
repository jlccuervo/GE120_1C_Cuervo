We should use a while loop if we do not know the number of times the loop will repeat until the statement is proven false. 
Vice versa, we use a for loop if we have a certain number of elements in a sequence or we know the number of times that the loop will repeat. 
In traverse, we can use while loop until the error of closure is acceptable and for loop if we are tasked to repeat the traverse for just a certain number of trials.

In programming, we cannot solve a problem in just one go. Just like how we always say "one step at a time", we also need to solve the problem part by part. 
This means that we will divide the problem into parts, solve it one by one, and combine each of its solutions to solve the main problem.
For example, your error in your levelling survey is too large and you found out that the sources of error are the distance between each turning points
and the levelling of the stadia rod. This happend because the instrument man didn't check the distance between the turning points and the rodman didn't level the stadia rod properly.
To solve the problem, the instrument man have to check the turning point which should have equal backsight and foresight distance and the rodman should level the bubble when the instrument man 
sights the rod. If these two do their parts correctly, the problem would be solved.

An example of task that is done manually and can be optimized using programming is area subdivision. This requires a lot of time to solve since it involves a lot of topic that's why it also have a 
lot of computations. This includes solving for the distance and bearing of the mother lot lines, area of the lot to be divided, closing line, dividing line, distance and bearing of the new subdivided lot lines, 
and area of the new lot lines. Creating a program that asks for the distances and bearing of the lot lines and the number of lot that you will divide it with, as well as the direction of its division, and computes 
for the new subdivided lot's technical description and area would be a great help in area subdivision.
